# HemI 2.0
HemI 2.0 (http://hemi.biocuckoo.cn:81/) is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.

In this new iteration of HemI, the online platform was added to make it more convenient for biologists to use without software installation. In addition, HemI 2.0 was optimized in many display details and provided more clustering options, including 7 clustering methods and 22 clustering metric for analyzing the gene expression data. In order to facilitate biologists to analyze function of genes or proteins seamlessly, the function query and a variety of enrichment analysis for multiple model organisms was added to HemI 2.0. For the visualization of enrichment analysis results, we introduced 5 commonly used and intuitive presentation strategies, including bubble chart, bar graph, coxcomb chart, pie chart and word cloud. HemI 2.0 provided more figure formats and resolutions options and all analysis results and publication-quality figures can be exported in a user friendly manner. We anticipate that HemI 2.0 represents a more useful heatmap-centered illustrator for the analysis and visualization of gene expression and function.
HemI 2.0 will be continuously maintained and improved upon users' comments and feedbacks.

The test data and scripts for this project are fully public.
